This site represents a reorganization of the Public Domain Bengali
Literature Archive previously hosted at

<https://www.isid.ac.in/~deepayan/bengalionline.net/>.

The main change is to move the "source" from a an ad-hoc XML
representation to markdown, and provide EPUB versions for
download. The impetus to revive this project is the recent
availability of practical OCR using [Google cloud
vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr).

Many of these will be incomplete works-in-progress. The primary
editable sources are hosted at
<https://github.com/majantali/bnarchive>, including ones in very early
stages (e.g., direct OCR output without proofreading).  More-or-less
readable versions will be copied over to
<https://majantali.github.io/bnarchive>. Edits / pull requests should
be against the [primary
archive](https://github.com/majantali/bnarchive).
