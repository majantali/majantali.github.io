This site represents a reorganization of the Public Domain Bengali
Literature Archive previously hosted at

<https://www.isid.ac.in/~deepayan/bengalionline.net/>.  

The main change is to move the "source" from a an ad-hoc XML
representation to markdown, and provide EPUB versions for
download. The impetus to revive this project is the recent
availability of practical OCR using [Google cloud
vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr).

Many of these will be incomplete works-in-progress. The ones in very
early stages (e.g., direct OCR output without proofreading) will be
hosted at <https://github.com/majantali/bnarchive>, while more-or-less
readable versions will be moved to
<https://majantali.github.io/bnarchive>. Even for these, not all may
be linked from the landing page.
