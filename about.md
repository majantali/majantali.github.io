This site represents a reorganization of the Public Domain Bengali
Literature Archive previously hosted at

<https://www.isid.ac.in/~deepayan/bengalionline.net/>.

A brief history of the project is available
[here](https://deepayan.github.io/misc/bangla-computing.html).

The main change is to move the "source" from a an ad-hoc XML
representation to markdown, and provide EPUB versions for
download. The impetus to revive this project is the recent
availability of practical OCR using [Google cloud
vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr) and Google Lens.

Works which are mostly complete are hosted
[here](https://github.com/majantali/majantali.github.io). Please use
this to submit edits or pull requests, or <a
href="mailto:deepayan.sarkar@gmail.com">email me</a> directly.

Many others will be incomplete works-in-progress. The primary editable
sources for these are hosted at
<https://github.com/majantali/bnarchive-wip/>, including ones in very
early stages (e.g., direct OCR output without proofreading).  Edits /
pull requests for such works should be filed there.
